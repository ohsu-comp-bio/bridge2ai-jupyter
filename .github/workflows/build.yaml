# Workflow for building the Bridge2AI Jupyter image and pushing it to the quay.io repository

# Optionally debug via SSH
# Ref: https://fleetdm.com/engineering/tips-for-github-actions-usability
#
# To use this step uncomment and place anywhere in the build steps. The build will pause on this step and
# output a ssh address associated with the Github action worker. Helpful for debugging build steps and
# and intermediary files/artifacts.

# Example:
#
# - name: Setup tmate session
#   uses: mxschmitt/action-tmate@v3
